                The Witcher Saga by Andrzej Sapkowski is a Polish fantasy series that has been translated into many 
                languages and adapted into both a popular video game series and a Netflix show. 
                But who are the characters behind the story? How are they all connected to one another?
                And how do they fit into the overall Witcher narrative?
                What countries do exist in this world? What monsters does Geralt have to fight?
                If you're new to the series and looking for some background information about the characters, countries and more then you are on the right place.
